    "description": "Notion is good tool but a very scammy company. They've price increased in the last year, which is fine, and this year with them wanting to push Notion AI have decided to move a bunch of features namely all the integrations from their Plus plan to the Business plan essentially asking you to pay double the price to keep the features you had. This would have been slightly less scammy if they'd allowed annual plan users like us who are prepaid until March 2026 to keep the features we were sold in March 2025 until the next renewal. But no, Notion was happy to take nearly $4000 from us and then pull the features from under us a month later. A company that is willing to treat customers like that should not be getting any business and especially not trusted with anyones critical data for anything",

It's clearly a bug with their backend, I got the same bug on any device I try to use Notion Calendar. No matter OS, or Device I use. I can't use Notion anymore. This is a terrible user experience, and for a company like Notion it's definitely  expected a much better support. EDIT: More than 1 Week Later, Multiple Bug Reports Submitted, Still ZERO help from the company. I guess they don't even have a support team at this point. I can't believe it.UPDATE: More than 2 weeks later, some support specialist has shown up and asked me to perform a task in notion calendar to send the bug report through their system. Ridicolously enough, there is a bug in that feature as well that's freezing up the app and it's impeding me to send them the bug report as requested. At this point it's clear that the Notion Calendar App/Integration is ran by a bunch of incompetent people that don't know what they are doing and don't care about the product or its users.UPDATE 2: More than 4 weeks in, still ZERO help. No suggestion on how to troubleshoot or fix the issue yet. None reaching out, other than low level employee saying \"they are escalating the task to the support team\". This is absolutely INSANE!Please don't use Notion if you have a business.If you wish to write a guide on \"How to turn raving fans into your worst haters...\" ask Notion.

    "description": "Misleading and Disappointing: Why Notion’s Affiliate Program Isn’t Worth Your TimeI’ve rarely felt so frustrated by a company as I have with Notion. What was supposed to be a mutually beneficial affiliate partnership turned into a deeply disappointing experience that left me feeling ignored and exploited.The main issue? Notion has failed to honor even the most basic commitments to its affiliates. I invested time and effort into referring new users to their platform, expecting fair compensation as promised. Instead, when it came time to receive earnings, I was met with complete silence. Despite multiple follow-ups, I’ve received no response, no payment—nothing.The lack of communication and accountability is staggering. It’s not just unprofessional—it’s downright disrespectful. Notion’s affiliate program lacks transparency, and their support is virtually nonexistent. For a company that promotes productivity and collaboration, the disconnect between their values and their treatment of partners is astounding.This isn’t just a case of poor service—it borders on deceptive business practices. If you’re considering joining Notion’s affiliate program, I strongly urge you to reconsider. There’s a very real risk that you’ll do the work and see none of the promised rewards.After this experience, I’ve completely lost trust in Notion. Their failure to communicate, pay, or take responsibility speaks volumes. Affiliates deserve better.Think twice before promoting Notion. Your time and trust are worth more.",

The one star is because after upgrading to a paid account in February 2024 I was never able to stop the payments, even though I stopped using it and closed my account. Again: the app worked fine. Used it together with some other people for a creative project: we liked it fine. We didn't like it enough to keep using it, so I reverted it back to a free account sometime in the fall of 2024. Then later on, realized I was still getting charged. I assumed I'd done something wrong, so on December 9 2024 logged in to my free account to figure out what step I failed to take. I thought I'd gotten it done but a couple months later: still getting charged. Every month. So on February 10 2025 I write to their billing dept, explaining all this. They never respond, I keep getting billed, and now, April 11 2025, I'm on the phone with my credit card company, who tell me the only way to stop the charges is to fully cancel my credit card.So again: it's fine. The app is fine. But whatever's going on in their billing department cancels out all of its qualities.",

To be honest, I never even checked if there are any limits on the free tier, simply because after using it actively and daily for more than two years, I’ve NEVER hit a single one.  I won’t try to list all the features — there are tons, and they genuinely boost your daily productivity by dozens of percent, if not more. Your thoughts, plans, ideas, tasks, and events are always perfectly organized and instantly accessible from ANYy device, anywhere in the world.  Where else can you get something like that?

    "description": "I have used Notion on and off for the last 6 years for both personal and business purposes. The core system is very useful as a productivity tool. There is a learning curve to use it effectively and it can be easy to spend more time building templates and systems than you will save using the systems. My biggest complaint is with their billing and support. Every member that is added to a workspace will cost you, there is no \"Viewer\" option unlike other team productivity workbase tools, and this is fair if members are using the tool and getting value out of it. The problem is you ARE NOT informed of this billing when you add members to the team and there is a 3 day refund window policy. I only found out about the billing after looking at my credit card statement. I requested a refund for the seats I was charged for without my knowledge, not the one I willingly purchased, 4 days later - unaware of the 3 day policy - and was told I was eligible for a refund for the licenses I was not aware I was buying. Later when I went to get the refund I was told I was uneligible for a refund as it was outside the 3 day refund window. After escalating the refund request to another team I did receive the refund I requested; however I was not informed by the support team this would happen, all my licenses got revoked, even the one I willing paid for and did not ask to have refunded and my data was set to expire within a few days. Again, the only reason I found out about the refund is from looking at my credit card statement.I am done with Notion forever. There are so many better tools out there both for your time and your budget.",

Only after insisting did they offer me a laughable $12, while they basically stole around $60 from me. I repeatedly asked to speak with a supervisor, and they consistently ignored me. It was only when I involved their legal department and head of finance that I finally got reimbursed.I still have a freemium account, but after this ugly experience, I don’t enjoy using it at all.

    "title": "Deceptive Billing, Terrible Support, and Zero Accountability – Avoid Notion!",
    "description": "I’m writing this review to warn others about Notion’s deceptive billing practices, inaccessible customer service, and complete lack of accountability. What started as a simple subscription downgrade request turned into a months-long nightmare that left me financially strained and deeply frustrated. If you’re considering Notion, think twice—their app might be sleek, but their customer service is a disaster.\nHere’s what happened: I signed up for Notion’s premium plan but quickly realized the app didn’t offer the features I needed. I hadn’t used it in over two months, so on March 13, 2025, I emailed their support team to downgrade my account to the free plan, as their emails had stated I’d lose premium access if payment failed. I was fine with that—I just wanted out of the subscription. Instead of honoring my request, Notion kept trying to charge me. On March 18, 2025, the second funds hit my account, they deducted the payment—despite my clear instructions to downgrade.\nI immediately requested a refund, explaining that I’m unemployed and needed the money for a specialist medical appointment that day. Because of Notion’s actions, I had to borrow money from my son to cover the cost, adding stress to an already difficult situation. Their response? A canned email from “the representative” (who, by the way, is just a Campus Ambassador, not even a proper support rep—more on that later), citing a 3-day refund window and refusing to help. The invoice they charged me for was issued on February 22, 2025, but I’d already requested a downgrade on March 13, well before the payment was taken. They ignored that completely.\nIt gets worse. Notion’s emails are contradictory and misleading. I have a screenshot of an email stating it was their “last attempt” to process payment, but the representative later claimed they can retry up to 8 times over a month—a direct contradiction. He also mentioned an unpaid invoice from January 22, 2025, but I’ve searched my inbox, spam, and trash—there’s no such invoice. Either they never sent it, or they’re making it up to justify taking my money. When I called them out on this, they went silent.\nTheir downgrade process is a joke. They told me to downgrade via the web app (Settings > Billing > Change Plan), but I only have mobile access and told them so multiple times. Here’s the kicker: I could delete my account on mobile with no issue, but downgrading? Impossible with their instructions. They set me up to fail and then blamed me for it.\nI escalated my complaint, demanding a refund and for someone senior to step in. The person responding, who I later found out on LinkedIn is just a Campus Ambassador (basically a student rep for marketing, not support), refused to escalate. He kept hiding behind “policy,” even though I hadn’t used the app in months and had clearly requested a downgrade. I gave them a 24-hour deadline to respond—three days ago. They’ve gone completely silent, which shows how little they care about their customers.\nNotion’s behavior is predatory and unethical. They ignored my downgrade request, took money I couldn’t afford to lose, and left me to deal with the consequences. I’m now pursuing a formal complaint with the Department of Fair Trading in Australia (where Notion has an office in Sydney) and considering the Federal Trade Commission in the US (their HQ is in San Francisco). I’ll also be sharing this experience on every platform I can to warn others. Notion might have a shiny app, but their customer service is a black hole—don’t trust them with your money.\nIf you’re thinking of using Notion, beware: their billing practices are deceptive, their support is inaccessible, and they’ll leave you high and dry when things go wrong. Save yourself the headache and look elsewhere.",
