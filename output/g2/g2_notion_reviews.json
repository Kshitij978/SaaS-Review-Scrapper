    "description": "What I love most about Notion is how customizable and flexible it is. I’ve built personalized dashboards for each client, organized all my design files, and even created moodboards right inside Notion. The ability to switch between kanban, calendar, and list views makes managing design workflows a breeze. Sharing pages with clients and getting real-time feedback saves a lot of time and keeps everything organized. Sometimes, the mobile experience isn't as smooth as the desktop version, especially when working with image-heavy pages. It also lacks deep integrations with key design tools like Figma or Adobe Creative Cloud, which would make it even more powerful for creatives like me. And while the app is super flexible, beginners might feel overwhelmed with the blank canvas at first. Notion helped me bring all my design work, client tasks, and creative ideas into one place, making everything easier to manage and much more organized.",

    "description": "I really appreciate how versatile Notion is having docs, tasks, and databases all in one place. The clean UI, customizable templates, and ability to link pages make it perfect for both structured planning and creative brainstorming.  Notion works great for managing both personal and team projects. During my Product Fellowship, we used it to structure our entire product workflow from ideation and roadmaps to documentation and feedback tracking. The real-time collaboration and ability to customize boards, tables, and checklists made everything smoother and more transparent. The mobile version can lag, especially when navigating large or complex pages. Offline access is also limited, which can be inconvenient when working on the go or in low-connectivity areas.  It can feel a bit overwhelming for first-time users, especially when building more advanced workflows or databases. Some features like integrations with other tools or timeline views could also be improved for better scalability. Notion helps centralize all my work—documents, tasks, and product workflows into one organized space. During my Product Fellowship, it enabled smooth collaboration, clear ownership, and easy tracking of roadmaps, meeting notes, and feedback.  It solved problems like scattered communication, lack of documentation, and unclear task management. This has greatly improved team alignment, transparency, and productivity.",

    "title": "\"Notion is the Perfect Tool to Catalyst your Productivity\"",
    "description": "What I like most about Notion is there is value no matter how much you know about it. Just starting out, it can easily be used as a note application, just as good as Evernote or Mem, but with massive room to customize your interface as you would like. As you learn about databases, relationships, and the slew of 3rd party integrations, you have infinite directions you could take it. I use Notion as my planner, notes, contact list, project manager, resource manager, goal tracker, storyboard, travel planner, and any other idea I may have, like organizing my writing or tracking my inventory and orders through my multiple different side hustles. Along with the reliable Notion AI, providing different options directly in the workspace and in the chat box, with syncing between any number of pages, I can magnify the rate at which I work and brainstorm. Not many of my friends use Notion like they should, but if they did, I can use Notion workspaces to collaborate with them at the same level! Notion has as much potential as you do and will only reach that potential if you put some time into making it yours.  And in a fitting testament to Notion's capabilities, this review was [PROOFREAD!]  by the very AI it praises, showcasing the seamless integration of human creativity and artificial intelligence. Notion has not touched this text. As a platform for optimizing my productivity, it is perfect. What I find difficult is understanding how I can best use it, from the very beginning. I think many people will try the application, hearing how useful it is, but be disappointed when they first try it and think it's just another notes app. Of course it is a good one, but people may have large collection of notes, and likely won't want to spend the time copying those notes over if they don't know why Notion is worth it. Only when I did the research into Notion on my own, did I realize it's capabilities, and I had downloaded it months prior. I actually didn't even use Notion at all and came back to it later when my friend insisted that it would be worth it.  All I am saying is a little bit of a tutorial at the beginning, embedded in the first launch of the program, could not only display how to use the app right, but give the launch of the program a professional air. Notion isn't just another notes app, it's going to change your life, and it deserves your attention from the start. Notion is fixing my cohesion within my life. I have always hated how everything that I use to get through the day is in separate application that I need to have access to simultaneously. With Notion I consolidate my life into one place, so I can see the puzzle I am building with all the pieces in front of me, instead of having to remember which spot I left each one. Imagine playing a videogame and not have a UI with your health, ammo, mini map, or goal trackers. You can probably figure it out or \"look\" in at your belt to know how many grenades you have left. But with the UI, you know without having to even look away from the path ahead.",

And of course integrations. I usually enjoy setting up project management tools, but this time I found it challenging. The UX is not easy to get. Content blocks are not sync. For instance, I couldn't find out how to have the same calendar view in every page, even when I connected the calendar to my gmail account. I can't customise background colors, setting up a good layout is impossible...but the most important, I can't find out how to track task with the team. Implementation is not that easy as it promised. Furthemore, templates are not that great. I tried to find Youtube tutorials and some knowledge from experts, but I couldn't find anything interesting. Notion meants to track marketing initiatives and campaigns. We need a system to have the team on the same page.",

A lot of the hacky solutions we did back then have been implemented, so they for sure listen for feedback. It has been easy to implement, and with the API, we get data from it. It is also easy to share and use. I use it personally all the time, and the company i work for has documentation on it. The rapid change-pace makes some solutions stop working because they simplified a changed something down the line. Has happen once or twice but it was me breaking it a biiiit before. Also, the formula editor is disgusting to use to be honest. It is a knowledge base for the company. I use it to do note taking and report on my tasks to my manager.

    "description": "Notion is one of the most versatile productivity tools I’ve ever used. It combines notes, docs, databases, wikis, calendars, project boards, and task lists into one clean, unified interface. You’re not locked into rigid templates—the flexibility is incredible.  I love how:  Everything is drag-and-drop and highly customizable.  It supports Markdown, slash commands, and real-time collaboration.  The database views (Kanban, table, gallery, calendar) make it easy to track projects or build internal tools.  It replaces a stack of tools (Google Docs, Trello, Evernote, Confluence, Airtable) with just one.  Plus, the design is minimal and intuitive, which makes it a joy to use daily. While I love Notion, it’s not perfect:  Offline access is limited—you need a consistent internet connection for full functionality.  For large teams or complex workflows, performance can lag (especially with very large databases or lots of embedded media).  It lacks robust permissions granularity compared to enterprise tools like Confluence or SharePoint.  There’s a learning curve for non-technical users who aren’t used to building systems from scratch. Scattered Information & Tool Overload Problem: We used to rely on multiple disconnected tools—Google Docs for notes, Trello for tasks, Evernote for personal stuff, Confluence for wikis. It was chaotic, and information was hard to find or maintain.  How Notion Solves It: Notion centralizes everything in one place: documents, databases, wikis, project boards, and notes—all easily linked together.  Benefit:  Reduces context switching between tools.  Saves time by having a single source of truth for everything.  Easier onboarding for new team members with centralized documentation.",

It's like having an assistant or coordinator to sit alongside you in meetings to capture all the important details and action items while you are giving your full attention to the meeting attendees. I cannot express enough how much this has helped me and my productivity!! I also love that I can ask Notion AI questions as I'm setting up new workflows and pages if I don't know how to achieve my goals. I am excited for Notion AI to get smarter. I want to reach vibe code levels where I can explain what I want a workflow to do and it can go ahead and build it for me and link to other databases. I also wish that the action items in the meeting notes could auto populate into my to-do list and help connect the dots to other items in the project. Organizes my entire business in one place. As an entrepreneur working remote on every project and often on the road traveling, I love having all my notes and details for all my projects accessible and no longer on scratch pieces of paper that I inevitably lose in the shuffle of travel. My next goal is to be able to funnel important pieces of this info into client portals so clients are seeing the same real time data I am for better collaboration and success!",

    "description": "I love Notion’s block-based pages and database system—being able to turn any page into a table, board, calendar, or gallery instantly is incredibly powerful. The vast library of community-created templates means I can get started on anything from meeting notes to product roadmaps in seconds. Its real-time collaboration features let me work with teammates seamlessly, and the sleek, distraction-free interface keeps me focused on what matters most. Notion can become sluggish on very large or media-heavy pages, and its offline support is still somewhat limited—editing without an internet connection sometimes leads to sync conflicts. The learning curve for advanced database relations and rollups is steeper than it appears, so power-user features can feel intimidating at first. Customer support response times can vary, and some native automation and reminder capabilities still lag behind dedicated task managers. Notion solves the “too many disconnected tools” problem by unifying notes, docs, task boards, and databases in one flexible workspace—no more juggling separate apps for writing, spreadsheets, kanban, or knowledge bases. For me, that means:  Single source of truth: All project specs, meeting notes, and research live in one place, so I never waste time hunting through emails or shared drives.  Custom workflows instead of rigid templates: I can build exactly the structure I need—whether it’s a CRM-style database, an editorial calendar, or a personal journal—and tweak it on the fly as requirements evolve.  Real-time collaboration without context switching: Team members can comment, assign tasks, and update status directly in the doc or board we’re already using, cutting down on Slack pings and duplicate status meetings.  Automated roll-ups and dashboards: By linking task databases to higher-level roadmaps, I get a live overview of progress without manually copying updates.  Altogether, these capabilities have cut my tool-hopping in half, accelerated onboarding for new teammates, and kept everyone aligned on priorities—so our projects move faster and with fewer miscommunications.",

It's easy to keep track of similar and different types of information and group them depending on what tags etc you have set. It's very customizable for any sort of project or tracking system you want to create. You just have to figure out what you need from the data and how you want to view it. I don't use the AI or automation much on a personal preference. The AI doesn't have the capability to edit databases which is the only thing I would most likely use it for In my opinion, the app could use a lot of work: - would be nice to be able to use keyboard shortcuts like /heading etc in app as well - img inserting has errors. More than one usually causes reloading and having to reupload img - Capability to reposition photos in gallery view - Dragging properties / tags around has lag time / sometimes gets stuck in between lines and you need to refresh - Gallery view with smaller icons for app instead of one box column only option - Option to bold / text treatment within properties (ex. Can bold a text property on computer, but option doesn't appear on phone) - Being able to paste in images from phone / keyboard - More text / style /color options without having to code - being able to duplicate new sync blocks that aren't connected if you want to create multiple at a time - being able to delete all synced block data when disconnecting instead of just disconnecting and leaving info on each of pages - More icon options - Being able to hide the original un-deletable name property on front view - being able to drag properties shown / hidden order in settings of database (currently have to hide all the ones up to the position you want new property to be placed and then reselect other properties you hid back to view) - Overload of assets and information with no proper way to organize - management of other apps used and consolidation of access - training hubs & center for all employees to locate information that is synced - Verification tracker for updating old assets",

    "title": "\"I think it's so much more visually appealing and has 10x functionality to google sheets\"",
    "description": "I find that Notion stands out as a highly customizable and visually appealing workspace, offering a range of organizational tools that support both my personal workflow and our team’s productivity. I really appreciate its flexibility—it lets me structure pages in multiple ways, like using nested pages, tables, and kanban boards. It's easy to navigate, and I love being able to embed content from one page into another, which makes it ideal for building comprehensive, interconnected resources. The clean and intuitive interface also helps our team stay aligned without the clutter that comes with more traditional documentation tools. I’ve found that Notion does come with a bit of a learning curve, especially when it comes to more advanced features like relational databases. I've struggled with trying to connect entries across multiple databases or sheets, which can be frustrating when managing more complex workflows. The formatting can also be restrictive at times—I’ve run into issues with unexpected locks or trouble figuring out how to reformat things the way I want. While I appreciate how customizable Notion is, really mastering all of its features takes time and patience, which can be challenging when I'm looking for quick, straightforward solutions. For me, Notion serves as a powerful internal solution by acting as both a centralized knowledge base and a collaboration hub for our team. It helps me consolidate scattered information into one organized space where I can easily access documentation, project plans, meeting notes, and shared resources. I really value the real-time editing, the ability to embed content, and how seamlessly pages can link to one another—it’s been a huge help in breaking down silos and improving collaboration across teams. It ensures that important knowledge isn’t just stored, but is easy to find and stays up to date, which makes our workflows a lot more transparent and efficient.",

    "description": "After using Notion for a couple of years now, I can confidently say it's been a game-changer for my academic work, research organization, and personal life. The platform's flexibility in creating interconnected pages and databases has revolutionized how I manage my projects and course materials.  The ability to embed content, link between pages, and create hierarchical structures makes it incredibly efficient for managing complex projects. I particularly appreciate how easy it is to transform loose notes into structured databases, and how seamlessly you can cross-reference information across different pages.  For academics and researchers, Notion's collaborative features are invaluable. You can easily share specific pages with colleagues or students while maintaining privacy for your other content. The platform's clean, minimalist interface reduces distractions while still offering powerful organizational tools when you need them. This past semester, I used notion exclusively for sharing course content, instructions, and tutorials with my students. The platform's export options, while adequate for basic needs, could be expanded to support more file formats and maintain better formatting fidelity. For academic work specifically, better integration with citation management tools and improved formatting options for academic writing would be valuable additions. I use Notion AI to quickly summarize academic journal articles, and to highlight the important information. The ability to quickly and easily generate work flow tutorials that can be shared with learners saves me time. The databasing abilities have made project management so much easier.",

    "description": "Notion’s greatest strength is its all-in-one flexibility: you can seamlessly mix notes, tasks, wikis, tables and boards in a single page without ever leaving the app. Its drag-and-drop block system makes building custom layouts intuitive, while relational databases let you link and roll up information across pages. Real-time collaboration and inline comments keep teams aligned and eliminate version-control headaches. With cross-platform sync and a rich template library, Notion adapts to virtually any workflow and helps you stay focused on what matters. While Notion is powerful, its abundance of features can feel overwhelming at first—new users may struggle to find where to start or how best to structure their workspace. Performance can lag on pages with heavy embeds or large databases, especially on mobile devices. Some advanced database functions (like formulas and rollups) have a steeper learning curve than in traditional spreadsheet tools. Finally, offline support is limited, so you’ll need a reliable connection to make the most of the app. Tool Sprawl & Context Switching → Notion unifies notes, tasks, wikis and databases in one workspace, so you spend less time hopping between apps and more time getting work done.  Knowledge Silos & Fragmented Docs → Its customizable pages and relational databases link information across projects, keeping everyone aligned and ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.",

    "title": "\"How Notion Became My Essential Hub for Work, Creativity, and Team Collaboration\"",
    "description": "I use Notion every single day. I appreciate the comprehensive knowledge it has about me, as I use it for journaling and personal knowledge management. When I ask Notion AI a question, it has all the necessary context to provide me with the answers I want, even if my description of my search is vague. It's hard to recommend to my friends because of the vast amount of ways you could use Notion considering that I am the type to tinker with my software and most people are not. Though the onboarding process has improved much in the last few years I've been using it.  I asked Notion AI to write me a review based on my workspace which has all my opinions from my meetings and journal entries and this is what it gave me (excluding links, of course):  Here’s my honest review of Notion, based on my experience onboarding colleagues, building workflows, and convincing teams to actually use it:  - Notion is truly the all-in-one workspace. I started using it for personal projects long before I pitched it to my company, and it’s been a game-changer for managing huge volumes of product photos and assets in a way that’s actually visual and intuitive—not just “another spreadsheet.”  - What I appreciate most: flexibility. Notion is basically the Lego of productivity tools—everything you build is made up of blocks, whether it’s databases, tables, notes, or galleries. That makes it easy to adapt for tasks as simple as a to-do list or as complex as multi-team project management.  - Its databases are a lifesaver. I’ve used Notion to track thousands of product samples and their distribution to vendors like Walmart and Amazon. Everything is searchable, filterable, and updatable—no more guessing what’s done and what isn’t.  - The team onboarding process has a learning curve, no question. Not everyone “gets” Notion right away, and I’ve seen that first-hand while training new hires and walking colleagues through image requests and workflow automations. But once people see how everything’s in one place and how they can interact with live data, adoption goes way up.  - Automations are another huge plus. I’m pretty big on workflow optimization, and Notion’s tools for automating repetitive tasks have streamlined a lot of the things I used to do manually—or worse, had to chase down teammates for.  - Downsides? Permissions and sharing can be fiddly, especially with large teams or when onboarding. The learning curve is real, and I’ve had to nudge quite a few people over the “just another tool” hump. But once the infrastructure is there, it pays off with real time savings and better collaboration.  - There’s a creative side too—I love being able to build custom trackers and dashboards for everything from e-commerce content to personal hobbies. I even showed a team member my drinks tasting database as an example of how anything you can imagine is possible in Notion!  Likes: Flexible and visual: Notion lets you organize projects, images, and information in a way that fits how you think and work. You appreciate being able to customize layouts, databases, and dashboards for both team workflows and personal projects.⁠ ⁠⁠ ⁠​ All-in-one workspace: You like that Notion combines notes, task management, and database features, so everything’s in one place—no getting lost between different apps.⁠ ⁠​ Powerful automations: Setting up automations and custom notifications saves you time and helps keep teams on track with status updates and reminders.⁠ ⁠​ Multiple views: You enjoy having options like board (Kanban), table, gallery, and calendar views to see data from different angles—much more versatile than tools like Trello.⁠ ⁠⁠ ⁠​ Collaboration: Real-time editing and sharing make it easy for team members to stay updated, track changes, and work together on shared projects.⁠  In short: Notion isn’t perfect, but if you’re willing to invest some time in setup and onboarding, it can totally transform how you (and your team) work, collaborate, and stay organized. For me, it’s indispensable—and I keep finding new ways to bend it to what I need next. Dislikes: Learning curve: Notion can be overwhelming for new users, especially during onboarding. Getting everyone comfortable and using it well takes time and patience.⁠ ⁠⁠ ⁠​ Permissions and sharing: Managing access and sharing with large teams can get fiddly, causing confusion at times.⁠ ⁠​ Bulk downloads: Downloading multiple files at once isn’t straightforward—you often have to grab files one at a time, which is inconvenient for image-heavy workflows.⁠ ⁠​ Occasional resistance: Teams or colleagues accustomed to other tools (like Excel or old workflows) may be slow to adopt Notion, even when it clearly works better.⁠ I created a product tracker in Notion and shared it with the company I work for. I also trained them how to use it. I also made some project management workflows in Notion that solve problems, such as generating style numbers for products and designs.",

Getting the average user onboard is quick, and overall onboarding is quicker than ever with bundles of information, tools, resources all in one place.  Implementation of Notion itself is no simple feat, but it has lots of ways to migrate and import data, and while the AI aspects work better while being fed with data, small tools/guides/trackers/Knowledgebases can be created in silos to manage a progressive deployment.  Before long you will  findyourself living daily in notion. My largest daily struggle would have to be slow database times. There is a diminishing return on database size.  Additionally the gap in user levels. Notion is something where if you get it, you get it quick. If you struggle, you must have never played with Lego as a kid and might just not get it. If that's the case, the more capable users will need to manage access very carefully to prevent accidents. Unification!

The built-in AI writing assistant accelerates content creation, from meeting summaries to structured documentation, saving time and reducing cognitive load. Its knowledge base capabilities allow for scalable documentation that’s easy to structure, maintain, and search—especially valuable in remote or asynchronous teams.

    "description": "Notion is, hands down, the most versatile tool I’ve ever used. It’s a true blank canvas that can adapt to whatever I need—project management, wikis, documentation, internal communication, or structured databases. It gives me one unified space to organise work, ideas, and teams without enforcing a rigid structure. The new AI features take it up another level: I can keep all my client notes, documents, and tickets in one place and then ask Notion to generate new content or answer questions with full context already loaded. It’s clean, focused, and free from unnecessary UI clutter like font options or locked-in workflows. It just gets out of the way and lets you think. The formula system in Notion is a bit of a learning curve—it doesn’t follow the same logic or syntax as Excel or Google Sheets, which can be frustrating at first if you’re used to those tools. Also, for new users, the sheer flexibility of Notion can feel overwhelming. It takes a bit of time and intentional setup to really unlock its potential. But once you’re past that, it’s incredibly powerful. Notion has solved the problem of scattered tools and siloed information. Instead of juggling separate apps for project management, note-taking, internal documentation, and client records, I now have everything in one place. This means less context-switching, better collaboration, and a much clearer overview of both the big picture and the granular details. The AI features are also saving me time by helping generate content, summarise discussions, and surface key insights—all within the same workspace that already holds the relevant information. It’s massively improved our team’s organisation, speed, and clarity.",

Lastly, I’d love to see even deeper integrations with external tools like Google Drive, Slack, and QuickBooks without needing workarounds or third-party automation tools. Notion is solving a major problem I’ve faced for years—scattered tools and fragmented information. Instead of jumping between separate apps for project management, documentation, note-taking, CRM, and content planning, I now manage everything within a single, unified workspace.

I've used Notion to run almost every aspect of my life for several years, it's excellent for my (very specific) needs. Honestly it has changed my life. Notion is hard to recommend across the board because there are big pros and big cons. In the latter column: I don't see Notion's vision of a single, integrated app reflected in this product. Even its companion apps (Calendar and Mail) are very poorly integrated. The main complaint I see from other people online is that Notion can come with a huge cost in setup time and learning curve, and I agree that this is a risk. Notion gives you an empty workspace, which is its biggest pro and biggest con, depending on your use case. If you want a team project management app that is ready to go, Monday or ClickUp might be better. And the lack of an offline mode is almost unforgivable.

I rely on it for summarizing lengthy policy drafts, rewriting content in a more human tone, and even generating first drafts of job descriptions or onboarding plans. It’s like having an extra teammate who’s always ready to help me think and write faster. Permissions can be a bit tricky, especially when you're trying to share a single page without giving access to the full workspace or when collaborating across teams with different levels of visibility. I’ve also noticed performance can lag a bit in large, complex workspaces or when there are lots of embedded databases on a single page. And while the AI is great for drafting and summarizing, it’s still learning—sometimes the rewrites feel too generic or miss the tone I’m going for. It’s also helping solve the “blank page” problem with AI.

I work for a small laboratory, where we all \"wear different hats\"  and have different roles. Since I have to be familiar with thousands of different processes (that may only come up once every 2+ years), it is easy to forget how I did things last time.

The Notion AI feature has greatly reduced time to find information across the org. I appreciate how customizable and flexible the platform is and that it can be used in a variety of use cases. Customer support is solid for small bugs, as they're generally quick to respond.  My customer support rep has been helpful and was able to connect me to the Product team for a feedback session. It seems like there are a lot of ideas and good directions, but things never quite get to 100% complete, which means, as customers, we continually have to find \"workaround\" solutions.  If there's a Notion update that then allows for some of the workarounds to be deprecated, there isn't usually a great way to transition off one solution to the next without massive manual work, which can be frustrating.  Our customer rep had some good recommendations for us on some of our setup, but again, they require massive amounts of manual work for what is realistically a small change in the grand scheme. The suggestion was for us to hire an external consultant to do the work for us, which was frankly a little frustrating. It shouldn't be so difficult to shift approaches, in a tool that was meant to be flexible, that it requires hiring a consultant.  The project management features, in particular, feel pretty half-baked still. Automations, while getting better, still require a lot of Notion-specific syntax experience to work correctly. Often the RIO of investing time to make the automation work ultimately doesn't save enough time to justify not just doing it manually. Database templates still don't inherently work correctly for project databases and haven't for at least 2 years. The fact that the task database creates an empty page for every task and subtask is painful and can cause loading issues as databases get larger.  A lot of Notion AI features have been teased for a while without any real updates (i.e, I first heard about the Salesforce and Zendesk integrations about a year ago, they just got announced as \"coming soon\", but my rep still can't give me even a quarter ETA to expect the release).  Page analytics rolled out and never went anywhere else despite having plenty of improvement options. Responses for anything that have to be taken to the Eng team seem to end up in a black hole and never get resolved or updated. Being able to search in one place across all of our tools is beneficial. Having a centralized place to put our knowledge for each functional team is useful. It's currently solving our need for a project management solution, but wouldn't necessarily recommend that to others.",

    "description": "- Really amazing UX and easy to work with it. Databases are super powerful and I love how it integrates in so many workflows. Templates is something I use as well. Like ability to mention people and pages. Ability to embed various other things docs/links/loom videos/youtube videos/github PRs is great! I just love that. For project management and working with various TODOs is great too. I love the new AI features: specially Search with AI, AI editor to rewrite my sentences with clarity. I also use it to extend and brainstorm ideas by providing current context and ask it to generate further. Working with tables. If there are lot of columns in the table, it gets really difficult to bring specific column to view. Also if someone has commented on something, I usually go from highlight in the column to comment. It is not trivial to understand where the comment is . It is sometimes very not-user-friendly.  I also find it difficult at times to add a new block below table. Have to struggle with context menu. Not always but often.  I also find sometimes notion search is slow in a really large org, AI search helps. I also ran into issues of importing a large CSV to a notion table or database, and it didn't work at all. - Notion allows me to write documents and allow me to refine my writing through AI writing assistant. It also helps me change my tone based on the audience I am addressing - It allows me to collaborate with many people in the team and tables as well as databases allow project management and tasks really good. - I work in a large org and I need to find lot of things from simple text to even errors in code. The AI search is great for that.",

    "title": "\"Notion makes threat intelligence program set-up easy.\"",
    "description": "I use Notion everyday from work to personal, and if there is ever an issue Notion is quick to help.  I love how simple Notion makes organizing team development. The ability to create separate workspaces for different teams is a huge plus. I also enjoy building databases and templates to streamline workflows. It’s easy to set up a threat intelligence team and create an internal sharing platform for an organization, giving guests access only to what they need, while keeping sensitive areas private. Some features I wish Notion offered: More robust form capabilities. For instance, being able to share a form with a guest that has a connected database would be extremely useful, especially for collecting IOCs or external inputs securely.  Stronger integrations with industry tools. Integrations with platforms like VirusTotal, Dehashed, OSINT Industries, and IBM X-Force Exchange would greatly enhance Notion’s utility for cybersecurity teams.  Cross-workspace database connectivity. If I create ticket trackers in separate guest workspaces, I’d like the option to centralize them into a single master database. Right now, there’s no native way to consolidate or let guests input tickets while viewing only their team’s submissions.  Improved Google Docs export. A smoother, more accurate export to Google Docs would be helpful for sharing reports and write-ups (same for PDF export, you never know where the page break will be).  More features for database analytics and visualization tools. Currently that area feels restrictive.  Native link analysis and graphing. A built-in feature similar to draw.io or Visio would be a game-changer for visualizing threat actor relationships and infrastructure mapping. Ideally, users could generate link analysis charts directly from a database. For example: * Set a header row to define node attributes (e.g., name, type, tags). * Define relationships using a dedicated column where users specify the related row and the type of relationship. * Allow right-click or hover to expand a node and view additional context or metadata. This would enable powerful visual mapping without leaving the Notion workspace—perfect for intelligence workflows, incident investigations, or entity mapping. Notion solves the challenge of organizing team development and intelligence operations in one unified platform. It allows me to create dedicated workspaces for different teams, set up threat intelligence programs, and manage collaboration without needing multiple tools. Databases and templates help streamline repetitive tasks, and the ability to grant selective access means guests can view only what they need—protecting sensitive data while still enabling information sharing. This flexibility lets me build internal platforms for intelligence sharing, ticket tracking, and research collection efficiently and securely.",

I use the Notion AI to help me write that documentation by creating the draft document which I just have to review and polish which is such a leg up from starting every document from scratch.  I also really love the flexibility of Notion.  I have come to use Notion for everything and so far it has been able to meet all of those needs. Notion doesn't seem to play well with Google Meet from a memory perspective.  We use Google Meet frequently for internal meetings.  Any time that I try to change views in Notion while I'm in Google meeting, whether I'm sharing my screen or not, I will frequently lock up my computer.  The Google meet with continue with audio only but the video is unresponsive until I can restart the browser. Notion is our company's centralized documentation repository.  The ability to search the Notion database and to use AI search has been extremely valuable for users who are unfamiliar with other department pages and don't know where to look to find information.

    "description": "The whole idea behind Notion is the relational databases. Once you can tap into that, it's a real superpower towards building a second brain. But even if you just need to jot down some notes, it's great, too. If you use OneNote, or EverNote, or things like that, this completely replaces it much more successfully. Now, with the introduction of AI, it can actually help you along with that journey. I manage my personal side-business with it, as well as my personal life, and I use Notion daily for the past 3 years. It has become an integral part of my life. I find that I am more productive when I use it, and less productive when not. As Notion continues to expand, there is concern from a core network of users that they might be adding new features at the peril of old features. Recently, they've added Calendar and Email apps. As well as the huge AI features. I think Notion is still Notion, but should be something to watch for in the future. A complete tracking database for all of my \"stuff.\" It also allows relational linking and ease of use to access that stuff. I am still learning how to integrate AI fully, but have used it to help with language and messaging from time to time.",

    "description": "What I like best about Notion is how flexible it is. I can build exactly what I need without it feeling complicated. One day I’m tracking tasks in a simple list, and the next I’m using a board to manage a whole project. It adjusts to how my brain works, not the other way around. I also love that everything stays in one clean space—notes, goals, and plans—so I don’t waste time jumping between different apps. It just helps me stay organized and calm, even on busy days. What I dislike about Notion is that it can feel a little slow sometimes, especially when I have a lot of pages or big databases open. It takes a second to load and that small delay can add up when I’m in the middle of a busy work session. Also, because it’s so flexible, it’s easy to go down a rabbit hole tweaking layouts instead of just getting things done. I had to learn to keep it simple or I’d spend more time building my workspace than actually using it. Notion is solving my biggest problem of having everything scattered across notebooks, apps, and random sticky notes. Now I have one place where I can plan, track, and review all my work without jumping around. It helps me stay focused on what matters most each day. I can see all my projects, deadlines, and ideas at a glance, which keeps me from feeling overwhelmed. Since using it, I spend less time trying to remember where things are and more time actually making progress. It’s helped me work smarter and feel more in control.",

It gets a bit overwhelming to figure out – sometimes I take some days away from a page/template/database to give myself a brainbreak. I suppose its best quality is also its worst quality. Notion solves the problem of unclearly communicated expectations with my team. The AI Writing Assistant does an outstanding job of rewriting and summarizing meeting notes and action items.

Notion acts as the command center for my business. It’s helped eliminate scattered tools by combining wikis, SOPs, project tracking, and CRM data into one customizable space.

It's expensive, but worth the money because you can search through your notion docs and ask it to read the page and generate more content or plans. It's all we use to organize documents! It was a steep learning curve because it's overwhelming. There's so much you can do with notion but it's hard to know where to begin.

    "title": "\"Flexible, Customizable, and Researcher-Friendly: A Powerful e-Lab Notebook with Room to Grow\"",
    "description": "Notion has become the central hub for managing my research workflow. As an electronic lab notebook (e-LN), it’s highly adaptable—I use linked databases to track experiments, literature reviews, project milestones, and protocols, all in one place. The ability to create custom views (calendar, timeline, Kanban) and tag entries by type or status allows me to visualize my work dynamically. It’s especially powerful when combined with versioned file storage, cross-platform access, and the integration of structured templates. Unlike rigid ELN platforms, Notion gives me the flexibility to build a system that aligns exactly with how I think and work. Notion’s performance degrades when handling very large pages or embedded content-heavy databases. There’s also limited offline functionality, which can be disruptive in environments with unstable internet. While Notion excels at flexibility, it lacks native scientific features like experiment timers, chemical structure rendering, or protocol version control, which more specialized ELN platforms offer. Export options are also limited when it comes to generating clean, formatted lab reports or PDFs for compliance or archiving. Notion solves the fragmentation problem in academic and lab work. Before, I relied on separate tools for note-taking, task tracking, protocol management, and project planning. Now, everything lives in one unified system. I’ve built a modular, searchable electronic lab notebook that allows me to track experiments by date, tag literature by topic, log progress across multiple projects, and centralize protocols—all cross-linked and version-controlled. This has improved my ability to plan experiments, retrieve information quickly, and maintain reproducibility and traceability in my research. It’s also significantly reduced administrative overhead and cognitive load.",

Web clips. Projects. Notes. Half-formed ideas. Stuff I used to scatter across Google Drive, Apple Notes, and a dozen apps now lives in one powerful hub. It’s wildly flexible, but also structured enough to keep me focused. And with Notion AI, building complex databases is shockingly simple. I created a multi-layer referral partner tracking system using Notion AI and ChatGPT faster than any spreadsheet or PM tool I’ve ever used. You can build anything in here—from a basic to-do list to an entire operational ecosystem. It’s like LEGO for your business brain. As much as I want Notion to be the only tool I use, it doesn’t quite get there. It’s not intuitive for team collaboration the way ClickUp is. Yes, you can collaborate in Notion, but it’s not built for that out of the box: you have to engineer it. So I still lean on ClickUp for shared project workflows. Also, Notion’s databases, while powerful, aren’t as formula-friendly as Google Sheets. If you want to do calculations, conditional logic, or advanced filtering, it feels clunky or flat-out missing. I still end up exporting or duplicating systems into Sheets. If Notion ever integrates those spreadsheet-level capabilities natively, I’d ditch half my tech stack in a heartbeat. Notion solved my organization problem, full stop. But even more than that, it’s helped me build systems that actually support the way my business runs.

    "title": "\"Review: Notion with AI – A Game Changer for Productivity\"",
    "description": "I’ve been using Notion for a while now, and the addition of the AI feature has genuinely transformed how I work. It’s like having an extra brain on hand — whether I’m looking for something in my own documents, searching across the web, or even digging through public pages, it helps me find what I need quickly and effortlessly. That kind of intuitive access has saved me hours.  What I especially appreciate is how seamlessly it integrates with my workflow. The AI doesn’t just answer questions — it surfaces content, links ideas, and makes navigating my workspace incredibly smooth. That said, there is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to formatting. The AI sometimes needs very explicit instructions to make layout or design changes, and it can miss the mark if I’m not crystal clear. It’s not a deal-breaker, but it’s worth being aware of if you rely heavily on visual structure.  Overall, Notion continues to be a powerful, flexible tool, and the AI makes it even more capable — especially when you need speed, clarity, and creative support all in one place. Notion solves the problem of having information scattered across multiple tools. Instead of juggling between docs, task managers, note-taking apps, and wikis, I can keep everything in one place — neatly organised and easily searchable. The addition of AI takes it a step further by helping me find what I need instantly, whether it’s buried in my own notes or across public pages and the web.  It’s also helped reduce the friction in managing projects and collaborating with others. I can create and customise pages exactly how I need them, and while the AI sometimes needs clear direction for formatting changes, it still saves me significant time by drafting content, summarising notes, or answering quick questions.  Overall, Notion helps me work more efficiently, stay organised, and spend less time switching between apps or digging for information.",

    "description": "I like that notion is easy to understand and flexible for any situation it can go from a simple task list to a very complex multi database power house. Makes it easy to introduce notion to new users and up skill pro users. It can get complex and there are some easy things you should be able to do that are way too complicated since they don’t have bespoke solution for. Since it’s trying to be everything it doesn’t do one thing perfectly and you seem to hit this wall everytime you plan a new space. Also when you have multiple accounts it’s a nightmare to try and use them at the same time specially if there are linked and share information it can get really confusing Notion has taken my 5 project manage software workflow into just one. It’s great to know that all my information is in one place that’s notions greatest strength sometimes its greatest weakness. It’s like having all your stuff in one room in your house great because you know everything is in that room but very hard to find at times",

    "description": "One of the most useful tools is just the sheer capacity of information that can be stored within it. Not hitting limits all the time and having to upgrade. This makes the AI tools for search invaluable because it feels like I’m searching my entire brain I wish styling there was a few more options. It’s never the end of the world and I love notions look generally. But the ability to choose different fonts or backgrounds colours for pages or even themes would be great. Especially for when publishing websites I used to feel like my brain was split across a million tabs, ideas in my Notes app, tasks in a planner, random links in my messages, and then trying to actually do anything felt overwhelming. I’d forget what I was working on, lose track of ideas, and waste hours just figuring out where to start again.  Notion basically became my brain outside my brain. Everything lives in one place, my plans, ideas, content, goals, and the AI helps me turn messy thoughts into something clear really quickly. It’s like having a system that actually thinks with me, abit like a co founder of my life!  I also love the AI writing tools within the databases, means I can rapid test ideas without overthinking.  I’m not constantly switching tools or overthinking everything anymore. I can just open Notion and get in flow. It makes me feel way more on top of things and way more capable. It’s literally the first app I open in the morning, and the last app I close at night.",

Notion is simple and easy to use, there are dozens of free or cheap templates to suit their needs, and I use it every single day.

On top of that, Notion AI makes it simple and easy to analyze my data and find things, and makes it easy for my team to do the same. I have virtually zero complaints.

I love how much easier it is to print out notes than one note (that has no borders). The forward hash button is amazing and makes creating tables, columns, doing any other fast action so much easier. I’m not sure if this is my computer or a new update to the app, but I am unable to highligt and select more than one image to add to my notion page at any one time.

    "description": "I absolutely love that my AI can integrate and research and review all of my databases and workspace information, this is invaluable when I am quickly  searching for info inside of a specific service we offer, and it can even read the contents of my documents and extract the specific phrase i am trying to clarify, like SOPs for my high net worth client consultancies. I dont like the separation of AI access to file contents when working from a page.  For example, when building out a new page I want to hit \"/\" and give a command to fill a table with the info from the file on the page above, but the AI cannot read the contents. Instead, I have to go to the file itself and select its options to ask the AI to read its contents and produce a table from there. This little nuance is something I run into a lot. The same effect happens with the overarching AI on the bottom right if the screen, vs when working with the AI on the page. The overarching AI does not have access to the page contents the same way the Page Specific AI function does when simply typing \"/\" and listing a commmand. Quick knowledge acquisition, streamlines note taking in real time And provides interactive database access on team and personal scales across the entire interface which is absolutely invaluable for our multi-leg organization.",

Simply changing the text isn't in the same place as changing the colour of the text.  I've made appointments several times but nobody has shown up.  Templates are great, but they're not a one size fits all model.  I've been using Chat GTP to help guide notion AI because, Notion AI isn't there yet. I'm asking it to build simple tables and it's building them with guide data, not what I'm giving in.  I will persist because I can see the value, but I've wasted so much time trying to understand the platform, when if the customer service was better and more available I think I'd be flyhing by now. I have several revenue streams and I'm trying to manage them all from one operating system.

What I appreciate most is its ability to create pages and content, add links, and even enhance the aesthetic appeal of a page with just a simple command. The work just gets done!  For someone like me, who works as a career coach, it has been absolutely fundamental and a massive time-saver. The AI makes it much simpler to create datasets, research information, and maintain consistency across my work because it's always building on the existing history. It's truly a game-changer for efficiency. Sometimes, the AI can freeze and become quite slow, which can interrupt the flow of work. Also, I've noticed it's not as efficient at providing improvements to existing pages. It shines brightest when you need to create something entirely from scratch. - Simplifies daily workflow: It makes my day-to-day operations much simpler. - Effortless content generation: I can quickly create new pages and add links with minimal effort. - Instant aesthetic improvements: It enhances the appearance of pages with just a command, saving design time. - Enhanced productivity: It's highly efficient for creating content from scratch. - Consistency and research support: It simplifies creating datasets, researching, and maintaining consistency in my work, as it always bases its responses on historical context. - Crucial for career coaching: As a career coach, it's been fundamental for my work, allowing me to save a significant amount of time.",

The platform's intuitive interface makes it remarkably user-friendly, allowing for quick implementation of new systems and workflows.  While I've already experienced numerous benefits from Notion, I'm excited about the potential to explore its more advanced features. For now, the current functionality perfectly meets my needs and continues to enhance my organizational capabilities. So far I haven't found any. I have a lot more playing with it to see what it doesn't do. Notion has solved several critical challenges in my workflow:  First, it has dramatically reduced the time I spend organizing information. Tasks that used to take hours of manual sorting and filing can now be accomplished in minutes through Notion's flexible organization system.  Second, Notion has improved my email communication significantly. By creating templates for common responses and maintaining a database of professional message formats, I've become more consistent and polite in my email correspondence, while saving considerable time in the process.  Additionally, the ability to centralize all my work in one place has eliminated the need to switch between multiple apps and platforms, saving me at least an hour each day. This consolidation has not only improved my efficiency but also reduced the mental strain of context-switching.",

But it is really easy to file things with Notion and using databases really helps filing and sorting data. I predict the AI function will help make this even easier in future.

Sabbath School Preparation – I create pages to organize my notes for Sabbath School. The AI writing assistant is especially helpful here, as it enables me to insert Bible passages, summarize lessons, and ask questions to deepen my understanding of words and scriptures. 3.

    "description": "Notion replaces a lot of the Google suite tools, and because it's not made by Google, it's visually pleasant and user-friendly easy to to work with. It has advanced features but lightweight enough none of these are a barrier to using it immediately.  Notion is also good for collaboration -- each document has easy to understand, fine-grained permissions and it's easy to comment, link to or mention internal and external documents. Unfortunately, Notion has reached the point where it suffers from feature bloat. There are probably too many features at this point, and I'd rather they prune some of the ones that are distracting, and focus on performance / UX clarity.  The NotionAI pop up is pretty annoying, it's easy to trigger accidentally, and I've never used it because I can't think of any use case in which it would be helpful.  If I need boilerplate copy I go to ChatGPT directly. The AI  search is vaguely useful but I'd feel more confident in the results if I could get links to source documents. The task I have the most trouble with is using advanced database features, perhaps if Notion AI could suggest alternate ways to organize info (but only if its unobtrusive / happens when I ask -- we don't want a \"Clippy\" scenario).  For users who belong to multiple Notion workspaces, the dropdown toggle is a bit annoying. I wish I could have a homepage that let me pull from different workspaces, or keep global favorites in the sidebar (pulling from any workspace I belong to). I also wish it was easier to see when I have notifications in workspace A when I primarily spend time in workspace B. I'm a software engineer at a medium sized consultancy. Notion helps me collaboration with coworkers and external stakeholders , manage non-technical work (especially QA and Support tickets, surveys, etch), take notes at meetings, draft routine communications (although I wish the formatting was more consistent when I paste them into Gmail) and read company manuals.",

If you need to track something or do anything, the building blocks that Notion provides gives you nearly infinite flexibility. Basically, if you can think it, you can do it. And if you can't do it inside of Notion, connect it to anything else through their easy connections/integrations. It's the most direct path to anything you need. Notion is great, but it's infinite flexibility is also one of it's biggest downsides. Sometimes, you don't want to have to think big, but Notion almost forces you to think bigger. It's like looking at the starts and knowing there's so much out there but not knowing how to reach it. Unlike the stars though, you'll eventually figure out Notion and how you can implement it in every corner of your life. After that, it's incredibly easy to use. Just make it past the early implementation hurdlers and you'll start using Notion as a daily part of your life and work. Notion solves nearly every organizational problem you can think of. If you need to track something over a short or long period of time, Notion grows with your needs. One of the most powerful additions to Notion was Notion AI. Everyone's looking at AI as the next greatest thing, but people are still unsure how to use it. Notion AI removes that question by giving you answers directly from the knowledge sources inside of your workspace. The more you use Notion, the better it gets. Now it's about getting information in there so Notion AI can help you use it (which is the big question everyone is thinking)",

    "description": "I love Notion AI's ability to pull comprehensive, context-aware answers from a variety of integrated tools—including Notion, Slack, and Google drive. This integration streamlines information retrieval by surfacing insights from across our knowledge base, project boards, and team conversations. It means that instead of switching between different platforms, I can get well-synthesized answers to complex questions right where I’m working.⁠  Equally valuable is the capability to create, collaborate, and edit content in a single location. I can edit on one page in a hub and distribute the same information across multiple pages - I love the version control this has for a single source of truth.  I've saved so much time utilizing Notion AI to be the first draft of enablement documentation when kicking off new projects. One thing I wish was easier was the ability to understand and duplicate templates & databases. I think I am creating a template that folks can duplicate which sometimes leads to folks editing the \"template\" Notion helps me to create documentation, enablement guides, a hub for storing information & project management.",

    "description": "🔮 The AI Assistant Notion AI is incredibly helpful. It assists with summarizing content, generating outlines, and brainstorming ideas. As someone who manages many projects, this feature helps me move faster and think more clearly. It's one of the best parts of the Notion experience, and I use it often. ♿ Accessibility for Blind Users This is where Notion falls short. As a blind user who relies on screen readers, I find the interface challenging to navigate. The block-based structure, while powerful visually, doesn't always translate well into screen reader-friendly interactions. Key problems include: • Unlabeled or confusing elements • Difficult keyboard navigation • Inconsistent focus and reading order Accessibility improvements would not only make Notion more inclusive but also empower more blind professionals to adopt it into their workflows. Notion gives me one place to draft, update, and organize specifications for the tools and products I work on. I can create structured documents with headings, tables, and toggles, making it easier to break down technical ideas or feature requirements. Its flexibility helps me keep everything connected—linking specs to tasks, timelines, or databases without juggling separate apps.",

It just works the way you think it should. Super easy to rollout to a company if you're looking for a solution that is easy lift.  That said... it's powerful too. Especially with the AI. I've just recently discovered this and it has honestly blown me away. Compiling information for our leadership is so much easier now that I have discovered this. It's the kind of search you have always wanted (also can connect to slack to scrape info there). Like all software like this, it's tough to keep it cleaned up when things get outdated. Any sort of functionality to help there..or maybe a tagging system that is clear and simple to keep track of things that need updated as things change could be great. Allows for one simple place to document and share work.",

    "description": "When I first used Notion it was a few years back before openai, chatgpt, and notion ai were readily available or atleast popular. It was simple to use but I overcomplicated it. With the new AI feature it makes it way easier for me to create pages exactly how I want them to look as the AI will literally set up exactly what you tell it to. It helps me lay out my business and personal and I've been way more productive utilizing it than when I was utilizing a paper calendar. Really no major downsides for me. I was utilizing Trainual and another platform and I was able to combine them into Notion at a much cheaper price and the added AI is really wild. I would highly recommend it. It is my personal and business hub. I use it for personal goals and tracking as well as my business hub for all documented SOPs, key initiatives, and my whole business operating system.",

    "description": "I’m really impressed with Notion’s AI feature. I love being able to enhance and optimize my notes directly in the app using the AI writing tools. Having AI integrated into my workspace has added so much more life, clarity, and depth to my note-taking and writing process. The only drawback for me is the billing structure. As an individual user, not a business, I wish I had the option to bundle the Plus plan with AI without having to upgrade to a higher-tier business plan or pay for both separately. It would make the experience much more accessible for solo users like me. Notion is helping me solve the challenge of organizing my thoughts and turning rough notes into clear, meaningful content. The built-in AI writing feature allows me to quickly optimize my notes, including topics I want to explore in my industry, books I am reading, and ideation, making them feel more structured, thoughtful, and actionable, all without leaving the app. This has made my personal and professional note-taking much more efficient and impactful.",

    "description": "Notion is a powerful, personal knowledge management tool that I love to use. It has become my place for writing drafts of content and organizing notes. The new AI assistant is able to scour your notes (which I pull in from Readwise) and help you with outlines and surfacing helpful quotes. I love the beautiful UI and how easy it is to share pages with others. I use Notion as a weekly journal and daily notepad as well for working on projects. I want to use Notion as a project manager, but the database interface remains cumbersome. I use it for project management, but only because it is where I am working most of the day, and I find myself reluctant to open other apps. The AI assistant is capable of helping to build databases, so I think I need to grow my skills for this. It is a perfectly integrated system for notes for the online course I am developing. I can store drafts, scripts, social media posts, design boards, etc all in the same place and keep them organized and searchable. If I add a team member, I will definitely be using Notion more effectively.",

    "description": "I love how Notion lets me centralize everything—Bible study outlines, business planning, product development, research, and AI workflows—into one clean, flexible space. It adapts to whatever I need it to be, whether I’m mapping out a game, managing a launch strategy, or archiving prophetic research. The ability to link pages, embed content, and create databases makes it feel like a custom-built control center for all my projects. Especially when using my phone, and nesting is a few pages deep, I can't see the page titles. Notion is solving the chaos of juggling multiple complex projects across scattered tools and documents. Instead of bouncing between Google Docs, spreadsheets, task apps, and sticky notes, I can manage everything in one place—from my Bible game development and subscription box planning to deep research and daily task tracking. It helps me stay focused, organized, and aligned with my bigger mission. I can visually map out projects, connect related ideas, and build systems that evolve with me—without needing to hire someone or learn complicated software. It's like having a second brain that actually understands how I think.",

    "title": "\"How Notion Helps Me Enhance My Productivity\"",
    "description": "I like Notion because it offers an incredibly flexible and visually intuitive way to organize my thoughts, tasks, and projects—all in one place. Unlike traditional note-taking apps, Notion allows me to create structured databases, to-do lists, wikis, and even simple dashboards that I can fully customize based on my workflow. I especially appreciate its ability to link pages together and toggle between different views like tables, calendars, and boards, which makes it easy to switch between big-picture planning and detailed documentation. The drag-and-drop interface feels smooth and natural, and the minimalist design helps me stay focused without distractions. Another reason I enjoy using Notion is its collaborative features—I can share pages with team members, assign tasks, and leave comments directly on content. It works well across all my devices, and I can quickly access everything I need, whether I'm planning a project, writing notes, or tracking goals. The community templates are also a great source of inspiration, helping me discover new ways to structure my work more efficiently. Overall, Notion feels like a digital extension of my brain—versatile, clean, and tailored to how I think and work best. One thing I dislike about Notion is its limited backlinking and knowledge visualization features. While it supports backlinks between pages, it lacks a true graph view like Obsidian’s, which allows me to see how my ideas are connected in a more visual, intuitive way. This makes it harder to explore relationships between notes or build a networked thinking system for research and creative projects. Additionally, Notion can feel sluggish with large databases or complex pages, and its offline functionality is limited, which can be frustrating when I need to work without a stable internet connection. Notion solves the problem of scattered information by combining note-taking, task management, databases, and collaboration tools into one unified workspace. Instead of juggling multiple apps for to-do lists, meeting notes, project planning, and document storage, I can manage everything within a single, organized system. This centralization helps me stay focused and reduces the time I spend switching between tools. Notion’s flexibility also lets me build custom workflows that match the way I think—whether it’s tracking research, planning a project timeline, or creating a content calendar. As a result, I feel more in control of my work and better able to manage both daily tasks and long-term goals.",

    "description": "I love being able to have everything in one place and being able to access it from my phone. It makes it handy for quickly adding expense records and writing notes. Relating things makes it super easy to keep track. Performance. The bigger your databases get the clunkier it feels. Not having offline access is also huge. I find myself trying to input records in crucial moments where internet signal is weak and it is VERY frustrating that I can’t open or quickly input data. This is what makes me consider leaving Notion all together and simply inputting data into programs that are good at that one thing instead with local access. Notion AI is seemingly getting better at integrating with the data input in to databases. It’s quicker to get relative info regarding my own data than before but it’s still a long way away. If I input 50 computers in my computer inventory and ask Notion AI to count how many computers I have it gets it wrong every time.",

    "description": "1. Databases (particularly the relational and rollup features and the newly added AI elements) make organizing a lot of disparate data way easier. 2. The newly added AI integrations (particularly Slack search and smart tagging in databases) make life so much easier. Really smart use of AI in a practical way. 3. Flexible enough to do a lot while remaining tight in scope+UI. 4. Really enjoying the suite of apps around work they're developing. Notion  Mail and calendar and forms are all excellent. 5. Smart AI direction and good value for the cost. They've made thoughtful designs of how folks (even less techy users) can actually use AI in their work. 1. Requires a strong culture of keeping with best practices, training, and data structure. Many folks simply don't know how to use Notion, so it can get messy fast. 2. Gates on certain customization block a lot of useful potential options. I'd love to be able to plug any analytics tool into Notion Sites instead of just Google Analytics. 3. No way to segment features to a subset of users. For any of us to get the advanced features, we're all having to pay the same price per head. It'd be great if pricing could be segmented by level and role. We're using Notion as our product knowledge center, processes center, mini CMS, mini CRM, and notes software. It's great to have everything in a single comprehensive location, especially as we're organizing content better.",
