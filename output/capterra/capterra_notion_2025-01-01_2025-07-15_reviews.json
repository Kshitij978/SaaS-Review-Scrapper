When it comes to note-taking itself, Notion is quite effective. However, the AI features leave much to be desired. Notion's AI is significantly less capable than ChatGPT, with unconvincing functionalities. The AI is slow, and when used on pages with extensive data, it experiences severe latency, often freezing for several minutes. Overall, Notion is an average note-taking tool that falls far short of my expectations. Due to my unsatisfactory experience, I have recently decided to switch to Obsidian, which I find much better suited for fully custom complex and useful note-taking.",
